# Imputation for systematically missing variables

This repository includes the Stata code to illustrate the use of conditional quantile imputation as described in the manuscript: "Multiple imputation for systematically missing effect modifiers in individual participant data meta-analysis" by Thiesmeier R, Hofer SM, Orsini N (2024). The Stata code uses the publicly available individual participant [data set](http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/i/ipdmetan_example.dta), describing the effect of postoperative radiotherapy on survival at different stages of the disease. The CQI package described and used in the manuscript is available for Stata 18. A log log-file of the example demonstrating the use of CQI is available [here](https://robertthiesmeier.github.io/cqi_missing_data/applied_example_cqi.html). In addition, the Data Generating Mechanism, as described in detail in the manuscript can be found in the [dgm.do]() file.
